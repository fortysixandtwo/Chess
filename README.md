## Chess Game written in C++ with mostly SDL.


### DISCLAIMER:

At the time of this writing I haven't bothered
tidying everything into a releasable state.
This includes deciding on a license.

### Beware: Some functions were found on SO, Tutorial pages and the like.
I should have annotated this where applicable, but may have forgotten
to give you credit.
In this case please contact me and I will rectify the situation :)

For now I just want to use git for cvs.

I continue working on this and i will be updating
this repository somewhat regularly and try to only
update the master branch with somewhat working code :D.

I view this as a project to learn more about cmake, git and SDL.
If you find anything useful, that is nice.
If not, that's okay too.


### WHAT WORKS SO FAR:
UI Rendering to a certain degree.
Server/Client

### REQUIREMENTS:
SDL2 <br>

$ make && make install <br>
